# Radix Colors for Kotlin

Radix Colors is a great color palette for software design and development. But its library is originally implemented in TypeScript, which takes a lot of effort to use in other languages including Kotlin.

This library is intended to provide a simple way to use Radix Colors in Jetpack Compose. It parses the original library and generates a Kotlin file that contains all the colors. Alongside all colors, it also provides a set of extension variables for Jetpack Compose built-in Color module, which supports dynamic color (a mix of both light color and dark color for light mode and dark mode respectively).

## Usage

The file `RadixColors.kt` (located in `output` folder) is generated by parsing the original library. It contains all the colors in Radix Colors.

To use Radix Colors in your SwiftUI project, simply copy the `RadixColors.kt` file into your project. The reason why we do not want to make it a Swift Package is that we want to avoid any redundant `import` statement in your code. We want you to be able to use it directly and globally, and can change some helper functions as you wish.
