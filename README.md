# Radix Colors for SwiftUI

Radix Colors is a great color palette for software design and development. But its library is originally implemented in TypeScript, which takes a lot of effort to use in other languages including SwiftUI.

This library is intended to provide a simple way to use Radix Colors in SwiftUI. It parses the original library and generates a Swift file that contains all the colors. Alongside all colors, it also provides a set of extension variables for SwiftUI built-in Color module, which supports dynamic color (a mix of both light color and dark color for light mode and dark mode respectively).
